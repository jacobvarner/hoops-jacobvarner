So the idea/reason for this post goes back to a few tweets I had earlier this
month about the individual win-loss records for Auburn basketball players so far
this season:

<div class="tweet-wrapper">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Assuming I have the calculation right, I&#39;m getting the following individual W-L for this year&#39;s Auburn major contributers so far:<br><br>Doughty: 1.82 - 0.91<br>Okoro: 2.09 - 0.39<br>McCormick: 1.66 - 0.87<br>Purifoy: 1.59 - 0.43<br>Wiley: 2.07 - 0.14<br>McLemore: 1.49 - 0.15</p>&mdash; Jacob Varner üë®‚Äçüíª üèÄ üåÆ (@jacobvarner) <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobvarner/status/1219104474414960640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2020</a>

I tried to explain the calculations in a general sense on Twitter, but it‚Äôs
difficult, even in even a series of tweets, so I‚Äôm going to attempt to explain it
and some other related stats here while also diving more into this data for the
entire Bruce Pearl era and looking at some interesting standouts.

### Individual Win-Loss Records Explained

I got the concept of individual win-loss records from advanced analytics pioneer
Dean Oliver, and specifically his book ‚ÄúBasketball on Paper.‚Äù Oliver is mostly
associated with the NBA, and so some things don‚Äôt directly translate to college,
especially in the context of one team, in my case.

Anyways, in my most basic explanation, individual win-loss records are supposed
to show how much each player contributed to the wins and losses of
the season. The best players should contribute more wins and less losses. While
not practical, I like to think of this stat as showing what a teams record would
be if you just had five of that one player playing all season.

Oliver‚Äôs stat takes into account two main things: the individual winning
percentage for a player and the individual contributions to games the player
has. Individual winning percentage is fairly easy to calculate, assuming you
already have the individual offensive and defensive ratings for the player
(those are fairly complicated, but you can
[read about them here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ratings.html)
or in Oliver‚Äôs book I just mentioned).

The simplest version of individual win percentage, which Oliver credits to Bill
James, is:

$$IndWin\% = \frac{ORtg^2}{ORtg^2 + DRtg^2}$$

The ‚Äúgames responsible for‚Äù stat is a little more complex, and I had to make
some slight modifications to make it fit Auburn and the data that I have
available to me. Oliver uses four different metrics, percentage of team
offensive possessions contributed to, percentage of team defensive stops made,
percentage of team minutes played, and the percentage of team games started. Oliver
gives more weight to the first two for reasons he explains in his book.

When I was getting these to work for Auburn, I found that the percentage of
games started skewed the data too much since Auburn plays a 30‚Äì40 game schedule
versus the NBA 82 game minimum. I also figured this portion was accounted for
enough with the percentage of minutes played.

So for my final adaption of the formula, I calculated games contributed to as:

$$GmResp = \frac{3*OffPoss\% + 3*DefStop\% + Min\%}{7} * TotalGames$$

Both the percentage of offensive possessions and percentage of team defensive
stops are factored into ORtg and DRtg, so their explanation is covered in the
link above.

Lastly, the individual win-loss record is simply calculated as:

$$IndWins = GmResp * IndWin\%$$

$$IndLosses = GmResp * (1 - IndWin\%)$$

I‚Äôm by no means an expert, and have never been a teacher, so that‚Äôs the best I
think I can do in explaining the stat to others. As with almost any of my stats
I use or reference, feel free to leave a comment below or
[reply on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jacobvarner) and I‚Äôll do my best to
explain it further if I can.

### Individual Win-Loss Records for Auburn Players

To get a sense of what the stat looks like with actual data behind it, here are
the individual results for the past two seasons:

![Individual Win-Loss Records for Auburn basketball's major contributors so far in the 2019-2020 season][image1]
_2019-2020 Season (Through 20 games)_

![Individual Win-Loss Records for Auburn basketball's major contributors in the 2018-2020 season][image2]
_2018-2019 Season (40 games)_

I‚Äôve sorted each of these tables by the games responsible for, and they should be
in order of the most impactful player, whether they contribute in a good way or
bad way, they‚Äôre making the most contribution.

Looking at the 2019‚Äì2020 season, the first thing that jumps out to me is how
good Isaac Okoro and Austin Wiley have been. Both are the top two in individual
wins and near the bottom in individual losses.

This stat is best used on a season to season basis because it is heavily
dependent on the other players playing around a single player and the overall
success of the team that year. Because of that, I went on to come up with my own
stat to better assess players from year to year and I‚Äôm tentatively calling in
win contribution and loss contribution.

### Win (Loss) Contribution Explained

My concept of individual win contribution and loss contribution is simply the
individual wins (losses) divided by the team wins (losses) for that season. In
my mind, I expected this to highlight good players on bad teams, and the data
for the Bruce Pearl era seems to support that, as you‚Äôll see eventually.

If you‚Äôre familiar with NBA advanced stats, this probably sounds very familiar
to Win Shares. Win Shares are also pretty complicated, but if you‚Äôre interested,
they‚Äôre explained fairly well
[here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html).

The reason I do not calculate Win Shares is mainly because they (like other
advanced NBA stats) rely on a value for league averages in a few key stats.
Because the NBA is a 30 team league, averages are pretty readily available. If I
was using this for college stats, I could use an SEC average or an entire NCAA
average, but I don‚Äôt think that is very practical and would have a lot more
caveats due to unbalanced schedules and the parity of the team's schedule.

Anyways, win contributions and loss contributions are my way of showing these
same ideas just in the context of Auburn basketball.

### Win Contributions for the Bruce Pearl Era

Like I mentioned above, win contribution tends to be a good stat for accounting
for good players on bad teams as shown by KT Harrell having the highest win
contribution in the Bruce Pearl era. It also is another way of looking at the
‚Äúbest‚Äù player on a certain team, but this isn‚Äôt always accurate because
typically the better players also contribute a lot more and are therefore going
to also have more individual losses associated with them.

Below are the top 15 players by win contribution for the entire Bruce Pearl era,
plus the final year of Tony Barbee‚Äôs tenure:

![Top 15 Win Contributions over the 2013-2020 seasons][image3] _Top 15 win
contribution percentages from 2013-2020_

Obviously, the 2013‚Äì2014 and 2015‚Äì2016 seasons were so bad that three and four
different players respectively managed to make the top 15 in this list because
no matter how many individual wins they had, dividing by 14 and 11 is going to
lead to a high percentage.

The dominance of the big three (Chuma Okeke, Jared Harper, Bryce Brown) from
2018‚Äì2019 is also fairly evident because they still managed to all make this
list despite the team winning 30 games that season. This stat would also
probably be even more impressive for Chuma since he missed 2 of the games that
are still counted against him in win contribution and games responsible for.

Also of note, Isaac Okoro is on pace to match Chuma Okeke and stay well under one
individual loss for the season, which is not something that many players that
play significant minutes can say. TJ Lang and Jordon Granger, the only other
players to have less than 1 individual loss for the season played 62.0% and
53.5% of team minutes in 2015‚Äì2016.

I hope this post sparks some interest in others and does a good enough job of
explaining the basis for the stat for those that were confused when I mentioned
in originally. I also plan to start keeping tabs on this more as the season
progresses and will certainly look back at where Isaac Okoro can sit on this
least by the end of the season.

This is the first post of me explaining some of the more involved stats I
calculate and Tweet about, but if you have any others in the past or future that
you have questions about, let me know and I might dedicate a full post to them
as well. I also plan on doing more visual analysis soon.

Thanks for reading, and hopefully my stupid obsession with numbers isn‚Äôt too
boring.
