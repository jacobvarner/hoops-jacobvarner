description: In the first part of this "Prep to Pros" series, I highlight some of the best development success stories where players turn a low recruiting ranking into a high draft pick or NBA career.
---

In this two-part series, I'm comparing high school recruit rankings and NBA selections for basketball players across the SEC in recent years. This first part highlights the hidden gems and development success stories where unranked or low ranked high school players used their college years to end up getting drafted or signed to an NBA roster at a much higher position than their high school ranking.

In part two, I will take a look at the opposite situation, where highly ranked recruits fell in the draft or ended up not making it to the NBA at all.

For both of the posts, I am using the 247 Sports Composite ranking for high school prospects since 2003 and then comparing it to a player's draft position or them signing an undrafted free agent deal and playing in at least one NBA game. I am also only considering players that were signed by an SEC school and then went to the NBA from that same SEC school. Transfers to or from other NCAA schools are not considered.

I now have a mostly complete spreadsheet covering SEC baketball recruits and paired with my spreadsheet on NBA Draft picks out of th SEC, this was the first series that I wanted to write on. I plan to have some other fun posts based on the information I've collected and will continue to collect, but I hope this was a nice look at players that have outperformed their high school recruiting ranking.

If there are other things that you would like to see based on SEC recruiting over time, please let me know [on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jacobvarner) and I might answer your quick questions or make a series or post based on what you want to see.

Thanks for reading.
