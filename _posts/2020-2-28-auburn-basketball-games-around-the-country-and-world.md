I just recently finished adding the game locations and other information to my
Auburn basketball spreadsheet, so I decided to pull some data on games by city,
state, and venue. Some of this data is still incomplete, because I have yet to
figure out where some games were played in the early 1900's and in some cases, I
can't find whether games were even played on the road or at home.

This post will be much lighter on "analysis" compared to some of my others, but
I still found it enjoyable breaking the games down by different criteria. A lot
of the data was expected, but there's some lesser known things in here as well.

## Auburn Basketball by State

Auburn basketball has played games in 35 of the 50 US States plus Washington,
D.C., Puerto Rico, and Mexico. Auburn has wins in each of those states except
for Alaska (0-3), Colorado (0-2), New Mexico (0-1), Wisconsin (0-1),
Massachusetts (0-1), and Iowa (0-1).

Auburn has played more than 100 games in Louisiana (123 games), Florida (130),
Mississippi (139), Tennessee (178), Georgia (229), and Alabama (1,437). Auburn
has a losing record in each of those states except for Alabama where the Tigers
have won 65.81% of their games all time.

Auburn is undefeated in Washington, DC (9-0), West Virginia (3-0), and Maryland
(2-0). The Tigers are also 11-1 in Puerto Rico and 5-1 in Utah.

Of the states that Auburn has won at least one game, Auburn has the worst
records in Kentucky (9-64), Arkansas (5-21), and Ohio (2-5).

Because there is a lot more data than can easily be covered in this post, I've
added the complete data from each of these breakdowns to a separate spreadsheet
that you can
[view here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eT3nzAnK3zFnL45LLWfgxvBAmq368-a-Yd7VyWhKR8o/edit?usp=sharing).

All of this information took awhile to gather and enter, so I thought it would
be worth using for a post. I hope to be back to more "analysis" in future posts,
but if you enjoy just looking at breakdowns for stuff like this, let me know. I
still have to go and enter opposing coaches for every team and can probably find
some cool trends from that as well.

As always, thanks for reading.
