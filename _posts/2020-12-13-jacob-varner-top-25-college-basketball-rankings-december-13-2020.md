I am not a fan of having to determine the best 25 teams in college basketball, especially early in the season. I think there is not much that separates teams, especially as you get to the teams that are in the 15-45 range. I am always impressed with people that attempt to put their opinions out there and believe that the best way to have an opinion of where a team should (or shouldn't) be ranked, is to also have an entire top-25 of your own.

While I spend most of my time focused on the SEC, I am still a college basketball addict and try to fit in as many games as I can watch while I can (and my wife will let me). I was lucky enough this year that the start of college basketball coincided perfectly with the Thanksgiving holiday and that my wife chose to go and visit her family while I opted to not travel in a pandemic.

With that, I am confident in saying that Gonzaga is the best team in the country and Baylor is probably right behind them. After that, you could convince me almost any other team deserves to be in the top-10 and I'd at least listen to you. Obviously, my rankings are below, but the only thing I will dispute right now is anyone saying Gonzaga and Baylor aren't the two best teams in college basketball so far.
