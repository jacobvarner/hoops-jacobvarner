description: A complete rundown of all NBA Draft picks from current SEC basketball schools throughout the 2010s decade.

With the NBA Draft pushed back this year, among all the other changes, it gave me time to go back and get data on every player selected from a current SEC school. The first draft under the NBA was back in 1950, and that's where this series starts. I am going to go over each of the decades leading up to today as well as a final article summarizing the draft history of all fourteen SEC basketball programs.

Make sure to check out other posts in this series:

This series is mostly to publish all of the data that I have gathered so far, but I plan to add to it and add other interesting posts on specific aspects in the future.

The early NBA Drafts had some odd formats and the rounds were either dependent on the few teams in the league at the time or arbitrary with some rounds consisting of just one or two picks. Because of that, for each of these drafts, I'm only indicating which pick each player was selected because I believe that is something that can consistently be compared for future drafts.

The total number of selections in each draft also differs, so I will indicate how many are in each year below or any other oddities that I noticed with the draft overall.

### 2010 NBA Draft

The 2010 NBA Draft started the John Calipari era at Kentucky, and throughout this post, his ability to produce NBA draft picks is very apparent.

### Team-by-Team Overview

Throughout the 2010s, there were 80 players drafted from current SEC schools out of 600 total selections (13.333%).

![2010s NBA Drafts team-by-team overview][image11]

The SEC making up 13.333% of total draft picks was their best percentage and 80 total picks was the most picks since the 1980s when there were several more slots available.

Kentucky made up for allowing Florida and LSU to have more draft picks in the 2000s by getting 37 draft picks in the 2010s, almost equalling the total number by the rest of the SEC schools combined. 

This also made the second decade in a row and fifth overall where every SEC school had at least one player drafted with Alabama, Auburn, Ole Miss, and South Carolina all having a player taken.
