description: A team-by-team breakdown for how each current SEC basketball school has done in the NBA Draft throughout history.
---

With the NBA Draft pushed back this year, among all the other changes, it gave me time to go back and get data on every player selected from a current SEC school. The first draft under the NBA was back in 1950, and that's where this series starts. I am going to go over each of the decades leading up to today as well as a final article summarizing the draft history of all fourteen SEC basketball programs.

Make sure to check out other posts in this series:

This series is mostly to publish all of the data that I have gathered so far, but I plan to add to it and add other interesting posts on specific aspects in the future.

To wrap everything up, I decided to put everything in the perspective of each of the current SEC schools. Kentucky has unsurprisingly carried the banner for the SEC in the NBA Draft almost the entire time, but several other programs have at least had eras of NBA Draft success.

While I only covered the NBA Drafts since 1950 in each of the decade posts, the numbers in the overview for each team will include all players drafted going back to the 1947 drafts before the NBA was officially the NBA.
