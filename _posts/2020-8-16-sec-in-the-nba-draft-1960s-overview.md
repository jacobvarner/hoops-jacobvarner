description: A complete rundown of all NBA Draft picks from current SEC basketball schools throughout the 1960s decade.

With the NBA Draft pushed back this year, among all the other changes, it gave me time to go back and get data on every player selected from a current SEC school. The first draft under the NBA was back in 1950, and that's where this series starts. I am going to go over each of the decades leading up to today as well as a final article summarizing the draft history of all fourteen SEC basketball programs.

Make sure to check out other posts in this series:

This series is mostly to publish all of the data that I have gathered so far, but I plan to add to it and add other interesting posts on specific aspects in the future.

The early NBA Drafts had some odd formats and the rounds were either dependent on the few teams in the league at the time or arbitrary with some rounds consisting of just one or two picks. Because of that, for each of these drafts, I'm only indicating which pick each player was selected because I believe that is something that can consistently be compared for future drafts.

The total number of selections in each draft also differs, so I will indicate how many are in each year below or any other oddities that I noticed with the draft overall.

### 1960 NBA Draft

The 1960 NBA Draft had an even 100 total selections with the first six rounds consisting of each of the eight teams picking once.

The current SEC teams had eight players selected in the 1960 NBA Draft with Kentucky having half of the selections. Tennessee, Texas A&M, LSU, and Auburn each had a single-player selected as well.

As the final SEC team remaining without an NBA Draft pick, Auburn finally had a player drafted when Henry Hart was selected by the New York Knicks with the 82nd overall pick.

### 1961 NBA Draft

The 1961 NBA Draft had 107 total selections with a format that matched previous years with the addition of the newly formed Chicago Packer (now Washington Wizards) having several extra picks at the end of the second round.
