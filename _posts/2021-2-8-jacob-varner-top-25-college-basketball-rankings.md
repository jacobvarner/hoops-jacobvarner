Several ranked teams picked up losses this week, but Gonzaga and Baylor continue to be dominant while Ohio State looks like the most recent team to make a case for the top-4.

Iowa lost twice as the Big Ten continues to beat each other up, Alabama dropped their first SEC game to Missouri, and Texas and Kansas had a rough week in Big 12 play.

Despite no major wins, Loyola Chicago is up to 13th in KenPom and with just three losses, they've made their debut in my top-25 rankings.

*I have a new system for tracking teams and will use it to base a lot of my decisions. As the year goes on, I find that a lot of people get sucked into the most recent games and put a little too much weight on recent results sometimes. Because of this, and because I generally like objective data as much as possible, I'm going to use these metrics in my post as well as the basis for my thought process.*

*I use [KenPom](https://www.kenpom.com) as my starting point and keep track of the top-50 overall teams and a few in others as I see fit. A key win in my rankings is defined as a top-50 win at home, a top-75 win on a neutral court, or a top-100 win on the road. I will try to record all losses for now, but will also denote bad losses in italics when necessary and those are just the opposite of the good wins. For instance, if a team loses to a team not in the top-50 at home, then it's a "bad" loss. Same for a loss to a team outside of the top-100 anywhere.*
