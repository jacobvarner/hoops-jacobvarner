Michigan returned from their COVID pause to get a comeback win over Wisconsin and remain in a select group at the top of the rankings.

With wins over BYU and San Francisco, both on the road, I have once again moved Gonzaga back to the top spot, but they and Baylor still seem to be a few lengths away from Michigan and even further from others with Villanova's loss.

Loyola Chicago got a big win over Drake in the first game but dropped the second game by 1 point in overtime, which resulted in them moving to the 10th overall spot in KenPom.

*I have a new system for tracking teams and will use it to base a lot of my decisions. As the year goes on, I find that a lot of people get sucked into the most recent games and put a little too much weight on recent results sometimes. Because of this, and because I generally like objective data as much as possible, I'm going to use these metrics in my post as well as the basis for my thought process.*

*I use [KenPom](https://www.kenpom.com) as my starting point and keep track of the top-50 overall teams and a few in others as I see fit. A key win in my rankings is defined as a top-50 win at home, a top-75 win on a neutral court, or a top-100 win on the road. I will try to record all losses for now, but will also denote bad losses in italics when necessary and those are just the opposite of the good wins. For instance, if a team loses to a team not in the top-50 at home, then it's a "bad" loss. Same for a loss to a team outside of the top-100 anywhere.*
