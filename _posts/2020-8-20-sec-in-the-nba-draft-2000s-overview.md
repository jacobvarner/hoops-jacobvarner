description: A complete rundown of all NBA Draft picks from current SEC basketball schools throughout the 2000s decade.

With the NBA Draft pushed back this year, among all the other changes, it gave me time to go back and get data on every player selected from a current SEC school. The first draft under the NBA was back in 1950, and that's where this series starts. I am going to go over each of the decades leading up to today as well as a final article summarizing the draft history of all fourteen SEC basketball programs.

Make sure to check out other posts in this series:

This series is mostly to publish all of the data that I have gathered so far, but I plan to add to it and add other interesting posts on specific aspects in the future.

The early NBA Drafts had some odd formats and the rounds were either dependent on the few teams in the league at the time or arbitrary with some rounds consisting of just one or two picks. Because of that, for each of these drafts, I'm only indicating which pick each player was selected because I believe that is something that can consistently be compared for future drafts.

The total number of selections in each draft also differs, so I will indicate how many are in each year below or any other oddities that I noticed with the draft overall.

### 2000 NBA Draft

The 2000 NBA Draft is known as one of the worst NBA Drafts overall and only produced a handful of successful players such as Hedo Turkoglu, Mike Miller, and Jamal Crawford.

Despite the draft not turning out to be a strong one in terms of NBA success, the SEC still had nine different players selected with two each from Florida and Auburn.

The Orlando Magic used both of their top ten picks on players from current SEC schools by selecting Mike Miller from Florida at fifth overall and Keyon Dooling tenth overall from Missouri.

### 2001 NBA Draft

The 2001 NBA Draft was headlined by Tyson Chandler and Pau Gasol getting selected with the second and third overall picks. There were also only 57 total selections because the Minnesota Timberwolves forfeited their first-round pick.

### 2003 NBA Draft
