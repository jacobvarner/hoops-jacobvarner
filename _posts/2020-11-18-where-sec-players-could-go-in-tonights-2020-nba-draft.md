DRAFT

I meant to keep up with this series and post a few updates over the last couple of months, but things got away from me. Instead, here is the final look at 40 different NBA mock drafts that I found across the internet and where each SEC player is projected to land.

Once again, I have linked each of the drafts that I used at the bottom of this post. Many are doing live updates, so they could even change from the time I am writing this (Tuesday night), especially with all of the trades being announced and the anticipation that the draft will be very unpredictable already.

All of these picks are based on the current order of draft picks and will not factor in any trades made the day of the draft or during the draft itself. Most of the drafts that I have included are actual mock drafts, but a few are "big boards" which are just a ranking of the best available players, sometimes out to 100 different prospects. There are also several drafts included in this collection that are first-round only, so those players projected out of the first round will be listed in less than the full 40 drafts I have gathered.
