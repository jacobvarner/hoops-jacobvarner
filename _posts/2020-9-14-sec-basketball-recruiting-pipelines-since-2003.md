I figured out that you could do some pretty cool stuff with map data in Google Sheets and now have quite a bit of SEC recruiting data so I figured I would take a look at where each SEC school has done most of their recruiting over the last two decades.

The data for each school includes both high school players and Junior College players and the state where they played in before signing with an SEC school. So some players are not necessarily in their "home state" but wherever their prep school or Junior College was located.

For now, I am just using data from 2003 because that is as far back as I can go on 247 Sports while still having full recruiting classes for each school. I hope to go back and add more data based on team rosters so that I can get more information on location data and other information that is more readily available even if there are no rankings or star data for earlier years.

Some of these maps are about what I would have expected, but there are a few that stood out to me and would likely be difficult to guess if you had no other information.

### Alabama Crimson Tide

Alabama has recruited 76 total players from 17 different states along with Canada and Sweden with a vast majority of their players coming from the state of Alabama. The Crimson Tide have the most players from the state of Alabama, as you would likely expect, but have 22 more players from the home state than in-state rival Auburn.

The top five states where Alabama has sourced their talent since 2003 are:

1\. Alabama - 32 (42.11%)  
2\. Florida - 9 (11.84%)  
3\. Georgia - 8 (10.53%)  
4\. Mississippi - 6 (7.89%)  
5\. Kansas - 3 (3.95%)

I hope you enjoyed the breakdown for each SEC school's recruiting footprint and pipelines as well as the new maps to show frequency. Now that I have maps more easily available to me, I might start incorporating them into more of the projects that I'm working on.

Several of the maps came as a surprise to me and based on [the many incorrect guesses on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jacobvarner/status/1304600510289379334?s=20) when I tried to see if others could guess what school Vanderbilt's map belonged to, I'm sure many others will be shocked by a few of these breakdowns.

I've got one or two more things that I want to work on based on my recent gathering of recruiting data, but as always, I'm open to what other types of posts or projects you'd like to see given I have the time and ability to find the data to answer your questions and curiosity. Don't hesitate to [reach out to me on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jacobvarner) to let me know which projects you have enjoyed or what kind of things you'd like to see in the future.
