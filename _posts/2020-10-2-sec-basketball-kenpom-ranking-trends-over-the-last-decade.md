description: A look at how each SEC basketball team has progressed or regressed in KenPom ranking from the preseason to the final rankings each of the years in the last decade.
---

If you [follow me on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jacobvarner) it's probably not a secret that I am a little obsessed with [KenPom](https://www.kenpom.com). KenPom ranks every team in college basketball based on their offensive and defensive efficiencies weighted against every other team in college basketball. Because of this, KenPom is a good way to see a pretty accurate ranking of where each college basketball team stands in any given year and any given game.

I decided to go back and look at the KenPom ranking for each SEC team in each of their games over the last decade. This allowed me to see which teams improved throughout the year, bounced between surpassing or falling below expectations, or just fell throughout the year. I've also included the range that each team stayed in throughout the year as well as their average ranking if you wish to see how a team did throughout a full season.

Some teams also have impressive rankings throughout the entire decade, like Florida and Kentucky, where they managed to be ranked in the top-50 of KenPom for almost every game over the last ten seasons.

For each complete chart of the SEC team's KenPom rankings, I've shown which games a team is above or below their preseason ranking with different shades of green and red respectively.

### Alabama

Over the last decade, Alabama has improved from their preseason KenPom ranking to their final KenPom ranking in five out of ten seasons. The biggest improvement for the Crimson Tide was in 2017 when they started as the 73rd ranked team and finished the season ranked 56th. The worst season in regards to preseason expectations was 2014 when Alabama started the season ranked 33rd and finished the season 53 spots lower at 86th overall.

Alabama managed to be ranked in the top-100 of KenPom for 325 of their 339 games this decade and was in the top-50 for 130 of those games. The Crimson Tide's highest ranking this decade was when they ranked 10th overall in the seventh game of the 2012 season. Their lowest ranking occurred when they were ranked 122nd overall in the 15th game of the 2016 season.

The furthest drop for the Gators took place in 2015 where they fell from 7th in the preseason to 34th overall in the final KenPom rankings.
